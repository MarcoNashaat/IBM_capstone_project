# IBM Data Analysis Capstone Project

## Overview
This project is a part of the IBM Data Analysis Professional Certificate program on Coursera. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, wrangle, analyze and visualize data using Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Data Wrangling
In the Data Wrangling phase, I cleaned, transformed and merged the dataset to prepare it for analysis. This phase involved removing missing values, handling duplicates and outliers, renaming columns, converting data types, etc.

## Data Analysis
In the Data Analysis phase, I performed exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset. This phase involved calculating summary statistics, creating visualizations, identifying patterns and trends in the data, etc.

## Data Visualization
In the Data Visualization phase, I created various charts and graphs using Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries to communicate the insights gained during the Data Analysis phase.

## Presentation
Finally, I created a PowerPoint presentation to showcase my findings from the project. The presentation included an overview of the dataset, key findings, visualizations, and conclusions.
